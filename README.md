## **Important message from Julien**
It’s time for the famous Simple Shell project. This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge 
you a lot about everything you have learn so far:
*  Basics of programming
*  Basics of C
*  Basics of thinking like an engineer
*  Group work and Learning how to learn


## **Resources**
### _Read or watch_:
*  `Unix shell`
*  `Thompson shell`
*  `Ken Thompson`
*  Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell concept page

  `man`  or `help`:
    `_sh` (Run `sh` as well)_


## **Learning Objectives**
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

###  **General**
*  Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
*  Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
*  Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
*  Who is Ken Thompson
*  How does a shell work
*  What is a pid and a ppid
*  How to manipulate the environment of the current process
*  What is the difference between a function and a system call
*  How to create processes
*  What are the three prototypes of main
*  How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
*  How to execute another program with the execve system call
*  How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
*  What is EOF / “end-of-file”?
